# E-commerce Platform
# 
## Context
Krepling is an e-commerce platform designed to give small-to-midsize sellers a complete, native toolkit free from the dependency on marketplace extensions to accomplish basic functionality, as well as having to hire or learn code just to have a unique storefront. As Senior Product Manager at Altar.io, I helped accomplish this towards two core pillars: the no-code storefront builder and the marketing automation system.

A project manager, designer, engineering manager, backend developer, frontend developer, full-stack engineer and myself formed the KRPL team. It was a complex project for the agency's typical MVP scope focus, but the team brought deep heuristic product experience and worked in close collaboration with the founders as if we held our own equity in their success.

## Problem
Existing e-commerce platforms market their extension ecosystems as strengths, but this creates long-term fragility. Merchants stitch together ten different addons to run their business; when one fails, the chain collapses. The result is wasted time troubleshooting, compounded subscription costs, and operational downtime.

For storefronts, the gap was equally clear: template-based builders force merchants into rigid, cookie-cutter designs. Customization either requires hiring developers or accepting a site that looks identical to thousands of others. Single-store owners needed sophisticated brand expression without the overhead of permanent technical staff.

## Solution
Krepling was built on an "opinionated-by-design" philosophy: maximum capability within foolproof UX, designed for the 90% of use cases that matter most while intentionally avoiding the edge-case 10% that breeds mistakes and confusion.

Key decisions included:
- A section-based storefront system with purpose-built components (hero, product grids, category lists) that allow deep brand customization through design tokens and configurable variables
- A marketing automation builder structured around three dimensions: When (trigger), Who (segmentation), and What (action), using a linguistic query builder that ensures every combination makes semantic sense
- Native marketing automation covering the full customer lifecycle, eliminating the need for third-party extensions to fill functional gaps
- Prioritizing ease-of-use over raw power, trusting that well-designed constraints prevent user error better than unlimited freedom

## Execution
Work started in July 2023. The storefront started with design system fundamentals, defining tokens, variable inheritance, and layer architecture, before building the editor interface. The automation system was constructed iteratively around use cases, from basic MVP triggers to complex multi-step workflows. 

I leveraged prior e-commerce experience to identify main pain points and desired outcomes for a typical user and validated them through internal testing and developer collaboration rather than extensive external research. The main challenge of what is "sufficiently simple", exactly, was navigated through repeated prototyping until the balance felt inevitable rather than compromised.

Technical focus was on performance at scale, supporting multiple stores per user, locales, currencies, and timezones while maintaining real-time responsiveness. We architected around Kafka for event streaming and invested heavily in mapping decision trees to eliminate linguistic impossibilities in the query builder.

## Results & Takeaways
Krepling secured $4.3M in pre-seed funding from Jason Calacanis' Launch accelerator and onboarded 500+ customers. The founders embraced the opinionated product vision and became one of the agency's most satisfied partnerships.

Key takeaways:
- Striving for simplicity often requires more complex and extensive underlying product thinking
- Opinionated products demand experienced teams. The responsibility of choosing for users only works when identifying their problems is second nature
- Agency environments benefit from more user-facing validation than timeline pressures typically allow
