# Bond Heart

## Context
Bond Heart is a wearable necklace from Bond Touch designed to let users feel someone else's heartbeat. As the Senior Product Manager, I led this project from concept to launch, overseeing both software and hardware.

The team included iOS and Android developers, QA specialists, a user researcher, three designers over time, and a hardware/firmware team based in China. It was a typical startup setup: lean, fast-moving, and occasionally chaotic, but ultimately rewarding.

## Problem
Bond Touch had seen success with its initial product, but growth was starting to level off. The user base was heavily centered on couples in long-distance relationships, which limited expansion.

When relationships ended, the product often lost relevance for those users. The challenge was to expand emotional connection use cases beyond LDRs, without diluting or disrupting the core experience that existing users valued.

---

## Solution
Bond Heart was built to complement, not replace, the existing Bond Touch product. The MVP focused on a simple idea: record a heartbeat, send it, feel it.

Key decisions included:
- Expanding use cases to parents, friends, and other non-romantic relationships
- Allowing non-users to send heartbeats
- Preserving distinct experiences through dual dashboards
- Prioritizing emotional resonance over technical or medical-grade precision

## Execution
Discovery began in early 2022 with proof-of-concepts, internal testing, and beta programs. I worked closely with the CEO to refine product strategy while managing trade-offs between battery life, design constraints, and hardware capabilities.

Final hardware and firmware validation took place on-site in Hong Kong. In parallel, I partnered with customer support and marketing to prepare for launch and ensure the product landed smoothly.

## Results & Takeaways
Bond Heart launched in March 2023 at a $99 price point with strong early results:
- ~10% increase in overall sales
- ~20% of active Bond Touch users also became active Bond Heart users
- Engagement averaged ~8 heartbeats per user per day
- The audience skewed older than initially expected

Key takeaways:
- New products can grow an ecosystem without cannibalizing the core if boundaries are clear
- Hardware decisions need to happen earlier than feels comfortable
- For emotionally driven products, simplicity often beats technical perfection
