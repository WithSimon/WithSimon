# Defining Product Strategy

## From Research to Strategy

Based on our discovery findings, we needed to translate user insights into a concrete product strategy that would guide our execution.

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Mobile-First Experience

We committed to designing for mobile from the start, not treating it as an afterthought. This meant:

- Touch-optimized interface design
- Progressive web app capabilities
- Offline functionality for core features

### 2. Radical Simplicity

Instead of building every possible feature, we focused on the essential user journeys that delivered the most value.

**Decision Framework**: Every feature proposal had to answer:
- Does this serve our core use case?
- Can we make it simpler?
- What's the minimum version that delivers value?

### 3. Integration-First Architecture

We built our product as a connected layer in users' existing workflows rather than a standalone destination.

## Roadmap Prioritization

Our three-phase roadmap focused on:

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core functionality for single-user workflows
- Basic feature set
- Mobile-responsive design
- Manual workflows

**Phase 2**: Collaboration & Integration
- Multi-user features
- API integrations with popular tools
- Automated workflows

**Phase 3**: Scale & Intelligence
- Advanced analytics
- AI-powered recommendations
- Enterprise features

## Trade-offs and Decisions

### What We Cut

Some features that didn't make the initial roadmap:
- Advanced customization options
- White-labeling capabilities
- Desktop native apps

These weren't bad ideas, but they didn't align with our strategic focus on simplicity and mobile-first experience.

## Metrics for Success

We defined clear success metrics:
- **Adoption**: 1,000 active users within 3 months
- **Engagement**: 60% weekly active rate
- **Satisfaction**: NPS score above 40

## Moving to Execution

With strategy defined, we entered the build phase. [Read about our launch and results →](post-3.html)
